# DoodleVerse

This is a drawing game where you are prompted with a random Pok√©mon, and are given 60 seconds to draw it. Afterwards, you will be judged based on how similar your drawing is to the original.

It is built with React on the frontend and Django and Tensorflow on the backend. Image similarity is computed using cosine similarity after extracting feature vectors from the images.
